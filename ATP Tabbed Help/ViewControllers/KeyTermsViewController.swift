    let def:[String] = ["If you see 300 listed in a swim activity, it means 300 m (meters) or yds (yards). Swimming is tricky when it comes to units. Some pools are measured in m and others are measured in yds. Simply pick whichever unit matches the length of the pool.", "The tempo trainer has three modes. The first mode beeps every 25 m or yds. Once you find your Swim TT (time trial) on your specs page, you will know mode 1 setting.", "Mode 2 on the tempo trainer means that you will hear a beep every 50 m or yds. This is a less accurate way to set your trainer to keep track of your pace but does have a very important function. This mode is typically used during beat the beeper activities. It is like a psychological game to beat the beeper when swimming 50 m or yd to get more rest and to test your anaerobic system. A little psychology can go a long way in swim performance."]
